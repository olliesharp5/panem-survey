# Panem Survey

Welcome to the Panem national population survey. This survey is designed to obtain information about the population of Panem. The motivation for users to submit information is that they will have less of a chance to be selected for the Hunger Games. 
In addition to the survey form, this program also contains a section where users can view the statistics based on current submissions.

## Demo

### A live demo to the website can be found [here](https://panem-survey-5c43aa3c8dea.herokuapp.com/)

## UX
This website is targeting the whole population of Panem.
The site is focused on simplicity and ease of navigation so users can interact with the survey as easily as possible. 

## User stories
As the sole developer of this website, my goal is to create a survey on behalf of the goverment that is accessible to a wide range of users and collects the data in an external document for later reference. 
I came up with the following points, which are applicable to the users:

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of this website quickly and easily.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate this website.
- As a user, I want to understand how to input my answers to the survey.
- As a user, I want the questions in the survey to be easy to understand.
- As a user, I want to see the statistics related to the survey.
- As a user, I want to know what is valid and not valid for each question.
- As a user, I want to be able to exit the quiz at the end of my submission.

### Strategy
The goal is to create an interactive online survey that reaches the populaton of Panem and is accessible to a wide range of users. 

### Scope
For the users, I wanted to build an interactive survey that is engaging to users and encourages submission to maximise the accuracy of the opoulation statistics. 

### Design
Due to this program being built for terminal use, there was not a design input.

## Deployment

### Version Control

- I used Visual Studio code editor to create my site and pushed to GitHub to the remote repository hangman-pp3.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

- git add <file> - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

- git commit -m “commit message” - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

- git push - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Heroku Deployment

- Heroku provides a platform for hosting web applications, including those built using Python. I deployed my Python-based survey on Heroku, making it accessible to users.
  
- The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.
